Is someone Spying me? Python Script to check if your Camera or Audio is secretly recording you

Monitoring for missing files, malicious processes, and unauthorized access to camera and microphone on a Windows OS involves a combination of file system monitoring, 
process monitoring, and access control

# About the script
While this script may not cover all aspects of cybersecurity, it incorporates some key elements that can enhance security on a Windows system. Here are some advantages:

# 1. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): 
The script checks for missing files, which can indicate tampering or unauthorized changes early. File integrity monitoring is crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents.

# 2. Process Monitoring: 
By monitoring running processes and identifying those not on the approved list, the script helps to detect potentially malicious activities. Unauthorized processes can be a sign of malware or other security threats.

# 3. Access Control: 
Checking camera and microphone access adds another layer of security. Unauthorized access to these devices could be a privacy concern, and the script helps identify such access attempts.
